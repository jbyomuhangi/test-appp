### Note: Please make sure you are using some v20 version of node (preferably the latest LTS version).

## Getting Started

First, install the deps
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```


Then run the dev server
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Review notes:
- I'm using the JavaScript `Map` object as some sort of in memeory cahce, but it has limitations in Next.js, so you may need to refresh the application a few times while going through the login flow.
